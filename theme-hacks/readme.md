## Goblin Notebook Styling Guide

This guide provides an overview of the CSS and HTML styling used in the Goblin Notebook to create visually appealing and functional layouts.

### Layout and Design Features

- **Floating Images**: Images are floated to the left or right to allow text content to wrap around, providing a magazine-like layout. This effect is achieved using the CSS `float` property.

- **Two-Column Layouts**: For sections requiring a side-by-side presentation of images and text, we use CSS Flexbox. This modern layout technique enables us to create flexible and responsive designs easily.

- **Responsive Design**: Images within the notebook are made responsive, ensuring they adjust to the screen size. This feature is crucial for maintaining the visual quality of content across different devices.

- **Inline Styling**: To achieve specific design goals, inline CSS styles are applied directly within the HTML. This approach allows for detailed customization of elements such as images, dividers, and notes.

### Practical Applications

- **Enhancing Readability**: By floating images and aligning text, we enhance the readability of the notebook. This layout mimics traditional print media, making digital content more engaging.

- **Dynamic Note Presentation**: Notes and highlighted sections are styled distinctively, making them stand out. This differentiation helps in drawing attention to important information.

- **Customizable Elements**: The notebook's design is highly customizable. Users can adjust image sizes, text wrapping, and column layouts to suit their content needs.

### Usage

To apply these styling techniques in your notebook:

1. **Floating Images**: Add `style="float: right;"` to an `<img>` tag to wrap text around an image on the right.
2. **Creating Columns**: Use a div with `style="display: flex;"` and include child divs for each column.
3. **Responsive Images**: Ensure images are responsive by setting their width to `100%` and height to `auto`.

### Conclusion

The Goblin Notebook's styling is designed to be flexible, responsive, and visually engaging. By combining CSS properties like float and Flexbox with responsive design principles, we create layouts that are both beautiful and functional.
